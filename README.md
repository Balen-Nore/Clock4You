The project aims to create a simple and user-friendly digital clock that displays the current time in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats. Users should be able to easily switch between the two formats via an interface, with the clock automatically updating every second to show the exact time. The project focuses on ensuring an intuitive design, correct error handling for invalid input, and saving user preferences between sessions. The goal is to develop a reliable and easy-to-use application that allows users to keep track of time in a straightforward way.

### 1. Functional Requirements:

**Current Time Display:**
The system should display the current time in real-time and update it every second to provide the user with an accurate time at all times.

**Format Selection (24-hour and 12-hour formats):**
The user should be able to choose between 24-hour and 12-hour formats with a simple button click, and this selection should be saved between sessions.

**Automatic Time Update:**
The clock should automatically update every second to ensure the user always sees the current time.

**Handle Invalid Input:**
If the user makes an invalid choice, such as entering an incorrect time format setting, the system should display a warning message to help the user correct the error.

**Retain User's Settings:**
The system should retain the user's selected time format, even if the app is closed and reopened. This means the user does not need to re-select their preferred format every time they open the app.

**Easy Format Switching:**
The user should be able to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats quickly and without delays or issues.

**Display Hours, Minutes, and Seconds:**
The clock should display the time in hours, minutes, and seconds so that the user gets a full and accurate time readout.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements:

**Performance:**
- **Requirement:** The time should update exactly every second without delay or loss of accuracy.
- **Importance:** The app needs to be useful by providing accurate time, with updates occurring without delay. Any delay in the time display can cause frustration and make the app less reliable.

**Security:**
- **Requirement:** Although the app doesn't handle sensitive user data, the system must ensure the user's settings and preferences are protected and stored securely.
- **Importance:** Even for simple apps, user privacy and security matter. Secure storage and handling of data, however minimal, reduces the risk of data theft or misuse.

**Usability:**
- **Requirement:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to use so the user can switch between time formats effortlessly.
- **Importance:** User-friendliness is essential for ensuring the app is easy to navigate. A simple and clear design contributes to a better user experience and higher user satisfaction.

**Compatibility and Accessibility:**
- **Requirement:** The application should be compatible with different devices and screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure wide accessibility.
- **Importance:** For the app to reach a broad user base and be available to users across various devices and screen sizes, it must be responsive and accessible on different platforms.

**Reliability (Uptime):**
- **Requirement:** The app should have a reliability of 99.9% and be available for users when they need it.
- **Importance:** To build trust, users must rely on the app to work when needed, especially for time display. A stable and available app ensures that users can depend on it without interruptions.

### 3. Requirements Prioritization (MoSCoW):

**Must Have:**
- **Requirement 1 (Current Time Display):** The clock must update every second to give users the exact time.
- **Requirement 2 (Format Selection):** Users must be able to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats quickly and easily.
- **Requirement 6 (Format Switching):** The switch between formats must be seamless and fast without any issues.

**Should Have:**
- **Requirement 5 (Retain Settings):** The system should save the user's preferences between sessions.
- **Requirement 4 (Invalid Input Handling):** Error handling is important to ensure the system is robust and user-friendly.

**Could Have:**
- **Requirement 7 (Display Hours, Minutes, and Seconds):** This is an advantage for the user, but not critical since the clock can still function with only hours and minutes if necessary.

**Won't Have:**
- **Requirement related to Alarm Feature:** Adding alarm functionality is a future enhancement but is not included in the current project plan.
